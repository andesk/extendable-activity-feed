# Relation Resolution Strategies for Activity Feed Items

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: Andreas Kleemann, AI Assistant
* Date: 2024-12-18

## Context and Problem Statement

Activities in feeds often reference related entities (actor, content, target). We need to decide how to handle the resolution of these relations while considering performance, memory usage, and developer experience.

## Decision Drivers

* Memory footprint of loaded activities
* Database query performance
* Developer experience / ease of use
* Flexibility for different use cases
* Maintainability of the codebase

## Considered Options

* Direct Resolution: Immediate loading via post-processor
* Proxy Resolution: Lazy loading via proxy objects
* Hybrid Approach: Offering both strategies

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Hybrid Approach", because it provides maximum flexibility while letting library users choose the trade-offs that work best for their use case.

### Implementation Approach

The implementation will provide both a direct resolution strategy and a proxy-based lazy loading strategy through the same interface. Users can choose which implementation to use based on their needs.

### Positive Consequences

* Users can choose based on their specific needs
* Supports different performance profiles
* Allows mixing strategies if needed
* Clear separation of concerns
* Easy to extend with new strategies

### Negative Consequences

* More code to maintain
* Need to document two approaches
* Slightly more complex codebase
* Need to test both strategies

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Direct Resolution

* Good, because simple to understand
* Good, because predictable performance
* Good, because better IDE support
* Bad, because potentially loads unnecessary data
* Bad, because higher immediate memory usage

### Proxy Resolution

* Good, because optimal memory usage
* Good, because lazy loading
* Good, because potential batch loading
* Bad, because "magic" methods
* Bad, because harder to debug
* Bad, because less IDE support

### Hybrid Approach

* Good, because maximum flexibility
* Good, because clear separation of concerns
* Good, because users can choose trade-offs
* Bad, because more complex codebase
* Bad, because more documentation needed

Technical Story: Setting up proper documentation practices from day one...

## Context and Problem Statement

Building a PHP library aimed to be flexible and extendable and usable for different use cases by anyone interested is quite an adventure, and we want to make sure we document our architectural journey properly. How can we effectively track our decisions, explain our reasoning, and help future developers (including ourselves) understand why we built things the way we did?

## Decision Drivers

* Need for clear documentation that actually gets read
* Desire to track our architectural evolution
* Importance of preserving context for our future selves
* Value of having a structured format (because who likes chaos?)
* Making onboarding new team members less painful

## Considered Options

* Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
* Wiki documentation
* Inline code documentation
* Informal documentation in README files

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)", because they provide a structured, version-controlled way to document architectural decisions. Plus, they live right next to our code where they belong!

### Positive Consequences

* Clear structure that makes documentation maintainable
* Version control alongside code... where it should be
* Easy to reference and link between decisions
* Helps maintain architectural integrity
* Future developers will thank us

### Negative Consequences

* Requires discipline to maintain (but hey, what doesn't?)
* Additional documentation overhead
* Need to keep ADRs updated as architecture evolves

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

* Good, because provides a standardized format
* Good, because lives with the code in version control
* Good, because captures context and reasoning
* Good, because supports linking between related decisions
* Bad, because requires consistent maintenance

### Wiki Documentation

* Good, because easy to update and cross-reference
* Good, because supports rich formatting
* Bad, because separated from code
* Bad, because may become outdated
* Bad, because harder to track history

### Inline Code Documentation

* Good, because lives directly with the code
* Good, because easy to keep updated
* Bad, because scattered across codebase
* Bad, because lacks broader context
* Bad, because harder to get overview

### README Files

* Good, because simple and accessible
* Good, because lives with code
* Bad, because lacks structure
* Bad, because can become unwieldy
* Bad, because harder to track decision evolution
